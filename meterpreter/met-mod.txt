could you wrap meterpreter so that the socket it gets handed is from a DLL you control, which responds to the communication from the meterpreter and then passes it along on another socket home once you get bi-directional communication patched up?
<burly> i don't know how complex the response messages are from the backend for meterpreter
<burly> but if they aren't terribly complex, at least that would allow you to not have to change meterpreter and maintain your changes going forward against the trunk
<egypt> that's the tack azerton is taking to get dns tunneling
<burly> semantics being, do you have to parse anything coming from it and then respond accordingly or can you just give it the equivalent of an HTTP200 all the time
